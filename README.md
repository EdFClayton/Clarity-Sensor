This repository is for a water clarity sensor built as part of a PhD program in Environmental Science at the University of Auckland (Te Whare Pūtaiao, Waipapa Taumata Rau, Tāmaki Makaurau, Aotearoa).
As code, materials list and build instructions become available they will be shared here.
Real-time data will be shared when online and links will be provided.

Update 06/12/2023. Code for sensor uploaded. This is for the prototype V0.1 Draft sensor, subject to minor changes in clarity calculations and data storage. Sensor will measure beam attenuation at 563nm wavelengths for 4 different paths and then estimate beam K (diffuse attenuation) and visual clarity. Sensor also measure water temperature to provide a correction factor to the LED's (emitted light intensity varies with temperature) and two pressure sensors (one for water and another for barometric) to estimate water level.
